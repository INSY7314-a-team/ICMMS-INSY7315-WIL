# Mobile Application Role Removal Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to remove admin and project manager roles from the ICCMS mobile application, leaving only client and contractor functionality.

## Files Removed
- `AdminDashboardScreen.kt` - Complete admin dashboard screen
- `ProjectManagerDashboardScreen.kt` - Complete project manager dashboard screen

## Files Modified
- `AppNavigation.kt` - Updated navigation logic to only allow client and contractor access

## What Remains (Client & Contractor Only)

### Screens
- `LoginScreen.kt` - Login functionality for all users
- `ClientDashboardScreen.kt` - Client-specific dashboard and functionality
- `ContractorDashboardScreen.kt` - Contractor-specific dashboard and functionality

### Navigation
- Login route: `/login`
- Client dashboard route: `/client_dashboard`
- Contractor dashboard route: `/contractor_dashboard`

### Access Control
- Only users with "client" or "contractor" roles can successfully log in
- Users with "admin", "projectmanager", or any other roles will remain on the login screen
- No navigation routes exist for unauthorized roles

### Data Models
- All data models remain intact (Project, Quotation, etc.)
- Fields like `adminApproverUserId` and `projectManagerId` are preserved as they may be needed for API compatibility
- These fields are not displayed or used in the mobile UI

## Security Features

- Clean separation of concerns between client and contractor functionality

## Build Status
